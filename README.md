## Objective
Oil prices are influenced by various external factors, making real-time prediction challenging. This project aims to develop a model that forecasts oil prices, providing valuable insights for customers and businesses to make informed decisions. Understanding the patterns in oil prices can significantly impact the economy.

## Sample Data Set Details
Data for this project will be extracted from various web sources to ensure comprehensive coverage and accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria
The success of this project will be determined by:
- Building the best model with maximum performance.
- Deploying the model using either RShiny or Flask/Streamlit.

## Protocols
1. All participants must adhere to agreed timelines, and extensions will not be granted.
2. All documentation, including the final presentation, R/Python code, deployment code, must be submitted before the final presentation day.
